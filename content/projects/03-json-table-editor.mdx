For a different project, I needed to edit a JSON schema file but writing the JSON was kind of a pain, so I built this small app to help me write JSON schemas.

You can view a live version hosted by Vercel or the source code on GitHub.

## Features
- Edit the schema definition with various value types (string, number, boolean, object, enum)
- Import and export schema files for future use
- Add rows to the data based on the defined schema
- Import and export the data for future use
- Preview of the JSON file to make sure your schema is correct
