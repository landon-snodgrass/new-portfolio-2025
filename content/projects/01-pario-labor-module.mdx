Documenting a labor is a complex process with no "industry standard" workflow. We needed to 
build a module that would allow midwives to document a labor flexibly and accurately. 

## Key Technical Challenges

**Dynamic and inconsistent data:**
Every labor is different and the data captured can vary widely. However, data consistency (not only 
within the labor itself, but across the app) is vitally important. This means our system had to be 
extremely flexible but also type-safe and consistent.

**Complex Form Architecture**
The labor charting module required managing over 15 distinct forms that midwives could complete in various 
orders depending on how the labor progressed. Some forms, like vital signs monitoring, needed to be submitted
multiple times, whereas other forms like delivery details were one-time entires and needed to be unique. 

## Solutions

**The single source of truth:**
To keep data consistent across the entire labor as well as the entire app, we moved most of the business
logic to the backend to keep the frontend as "dumb" as possible. The backend was in charge of maintaining
a consistent labor object and would handle passing the correct data back to the frontend. The key to this 
was ensuring strict typing on both the frontend and that backend which we managed with our OpenAPI type 
generation pipeline.

**Generic form wrapper and type parameters**
On the frontend to keep the forms typed and consistent, we built a generic form wrapper that used TypeScript generics to 
ensure each form was properly typed at compile time. The state of the form was pulled directly from the
backend so that our single source of truth never got out of sync. On the frontend we created configuration
files to map the various forms to the correct location within the module.
